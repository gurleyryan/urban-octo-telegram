# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

Refactored the existing code for this webpage to optimize it for accessibility. The hypothetical marketing agency wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their own site would be optimized for search engines. This included semantic HTML elements in the source code, logical structuring of the HTML elements, accessible alt attributes for the icon and image elements, sequential ordering of the heading attributes, and a concise, descriptive title in the title element. Additionally, the code was improved so that the links all function correctly, the CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure, and the CSS file is properly commented.
